TODO: mention somewhere how to add a list of name
TODO: mention somewhere that you need to reload the editor to get latest list of names
  - you could reload on each call, but that's an unnecessary overhead because names don't change that often
TODO: to bundle the extension with webpack before publishing it:
  - npm run vscode:prepublish
TODO: package the extension with vcse to publish it:
  - ./node_modules/.bin/vsce package
